## Welcome to GitHub Pages
Hello World!

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/aliciasueyee/aliciasueyee.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
First ever post here on Github Pages!

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
The project covered in this post is based on Week 4 of UMichigan's [Introduction to Data Science in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/home/welcome) on Coursera. I have its repository on my [Github](https://github.com/aliciasueyee/Introduction-to-Data-Science-with-Python), and the source data files. I hope to extend this project a little further, perhaps creating linear regression models.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for
**Hypothesis:** University towns housing prices are *less* affected by recession compared to non-university housing prices.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/aliciasueyee/aliciasueyee.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
