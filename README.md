Hello World!

First ever post here on Github Pages!

The project covered in this post is based on Week 4 of UMichigan's [Introduction to Data Science in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/home/welcome) on Coursera. I have its repository on my [Github](https://github.com/aliciasueyee/Introduction-to-Data-Science-with-Python), and the source data files. I hope to extend this project a little further, perhaps creating linear regression models.

So the point of this project is to compare the impact of recession on housing prices in university towns/non-university towns.

**Hypothesis:** University towns housing prices are *less* affected by recession compared to non-university housing prices.
