Hi!

My name is Alicia, and I started this Github page both as part of a portfolio as well as to challenge my ability to teach others.

I started my career in behavioral health, largely in risk assessment and connecting clients to services. I realized quickly that I enjoy being able to delve into layers of information and extract insights. I approach things with both a micro and macro-level perspective; thinking about how things relate to each other absolutely fascinates me!

I aspire to gear my insights into dollarized amounts as far as I can take it. 

Reach out to me if you've any comments or questions:
