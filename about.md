Hi!

My name is Alicia, and I started this Github page both as part of a portfolio as well as to challenge my own ability to teach others.

I started my career in behavioral health, largely in assessment of risk and connecting clients to resources. I realized quickly that I enjoy being able to delve into layers of information and extract insights. I approach things with both a micro and macro-level perspective; thinking about how things relate to each other is fascinating.
